<h3>Important Events</h3>
<ul><li>October 2024: Raised Rs 12 billion via Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) mostly used to repay Rs 7 billion debt and fund Rs 2 billion capex for land and machinery acquisitions.</li><li>2017: Acquisition of Sweden-based MAPE company expanded footprint in heavy commercial vehicle segment in Europe.</li><li>March 2023 and FY25: Made strategic investment in MMRFIC Technology with initial Rs 200 million stake (~21-22%), increased to ~30% stake, advancing presence in radar and mm-Wave sensor technology.</li><li>Strong order wins and contracts from aerospace segment including direct supply to Airbus, and a growing semiconductor equipment order pipeline with a long-term LoI worth US$17 million increasing to US$30 million in 2-3 years.</li></ul>
<h3>Key Growth Drivers</h3>
<ul><li>Expansion and diversification into high-margin non-automotive segments like aerospace, defence, and semiconductor equipment.</li><li>Growing share of xEV and tech-agnostic components within the automotive vertical, currently ~15% share targeted to rise to ~20% in next three years.</li><li>Strong demand from Indian two-wheeler market (~44% revenue) supported by premiumization and export recovery.</li><li>Global diversification with increasing exports to Europe, North America, and emerging markets (~32% revenue currently), driven by supply chain shifts towards India.</li><li>Strategic acquisitions such as MAPE Sweden to enter heavy commercial vehicle and international markets.</li><li>Increased capex targeting expansion in aerospace machining infrastructure and semi-conductor clean-room capabilities.</li><li>Strong order backlog with Rs 18.5 billion of confirmed orders.</li><li>Growing market share in precision forged components with advanced product development and customer relationships.</li></ul>
<h3>Key Risks</h3>
<ul><li>EV adoption reducing demand for ICE components which currently form 74% of revenue.</li><li>Automotive segment economic slowdown impacting demand from major customers.</li><li>Customer concentration risk with top 5 customers contributing 46% revenue, though declining.</li><li>Execution risk in longer development cycles and approvals in non-automotive aerospace and semiconductor segments.</li><li>Foreign exchange exposure from 32% international sales and geopolitical uncertainties in key export markets.</li><li>Raw material price volatility although mitigated by pass-through arrangements with customers.</li></ul>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul><li>Sansera Engineering is a market leader in precision-engineered forged components primarily servicing the automotive sector with a notable presence in emerging high-margin non-auto sectors like aerospace, defence, and semiconductor equipment manufacturing.</li><li>The company is strategically de-risking from ICE dependence by expanding xEV, tech-agnostic, and non-auto verticals, aiming to increase their revenue share from 26% in FY25 to 40% by FY27E, while ICE automotive contribution drops from ~74% to 60%.</li><li>SANSERAâ€™s ADR segment is growing rapidly with an order book of Rs 3.7+ billion and partnership with Airbus, with expected doubling of segment revenue by FY26.</li><li>The business enjoys global diversification with ~32% revenue from exports, primarily Europe and North America, with a strong order book exposure internationally (~62%).</li><li>The company has maintained stable EBITDA margins around 17% with expectations to expand to 18% by FY27 supported by favorable product mix and cost optimization.</li><li>Sansera has a strong balance sheet with Net Debt/Equity near zero post October 2024 QIP of Rs 12 bn used primarily to repay debt and fund capex.</li><li>Key risks include dependence on ICE vehicles facing disruption from EV adoption, slowdown in automotive segment, customer concentration risk with top 5 clients accounting for 46% revenue, execution risk in new non-auto segments requiring ramp-up and customer approvals, and forex risks due to 32% revenue exposure from exports.</li><li>Valuations are reasonable with the stock trading at 26.1x FY26E EPS of Rs 50.5 and 21.4x FY27E EPS of Rs 61.6, with a target price implying 22% upside.</li><li>The management team features experienced leadership with founder Mr. S. Sekhar Vasan as chairman, supported by executives with decades of experience in manufacturing and finance.</li><li>The stock presents an attractive long-term investment opportunity given strong revenue visibility, diversified and growing product portfolio, global diversification, strategic investments in emerging technologies, and improving margins.</li></ul>
<h3>Recommendation Rationale</h3>
<ul><li>Diversification strategy reduces reliance on traditional ICE automotive segments, mitigating risk from electrification disruption.</li><li>Strong revenue growth expected (~17% CAGR FY25-27E) driven by both automotive and expanding high-margin non-automotive segments (aerospace, defence, semiconductor).</li><li>Robust balance sheet post QIP with net debt nearly zero, providing financial flexibility for capex and acquisitions.</li><li>Strong order book (~Rs 18.5 bn) with ~62% international exposure, supporting revenue visibility and growth.</li><li>Reasonable valuation at 21.4x FY27E EPS and 26x FY27E EV/EBITDA with 22% upside to target price supports buy recommendation.</li></ul>
