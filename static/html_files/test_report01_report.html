<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul><li>India&#x27;s cables and wires (C&amp;W) industry was estimated at INR 900bn in FY25 and is forecasted to grow at a 12% CAGR to INR 1,253bn by FY28, driven by real estate, infrastructure development, renewable investments, urbanization, and data center expansion.</li><li>Exports play a key role, growing at 16% CAGR CY18-24, helping India increase its global export share from 0.9% to 1.3%. Indian manufacturers benefit from &#x27;China+1&#x27; strategy and rising global demand for certified cables.</li><li>The Indian C&amp;W industry is transitioning from unorganized (~24%) to organized players expanding capacity and capabilities.
