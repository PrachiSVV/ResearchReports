<h1>Mirae Asset Sharekhan IPO note on HDB Financial</h1>
<p><b>Published Date:</b> 2025-06-23</p>
<p><b>Source:</b> Sharekhan</p>
<h3>Company Name</h3>
<p>HDB Financial Services</p>
<h3>Sector</h3>
<p>Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC)</p>
<h3>Analyst View</h3>
<p>The IPO is reasonably valued with a strong parentage, robust growth, and diversified portfolio providing a long runway for growth. Sector tailwinds and company fundamentals support a subscribe recommendation with positive medium to long term outlook.</p>
<h3>Business Summary</h3>
<p>HDB Financial Services, a subsidiary of HDFC Bank, is the second largest and fastest growing customer franchise NBFC in India serving 1.9 crore customers as of March 2025. The company focuses on underserved and underbanked customers in low to middle-income households with minimal or no credit history. The gross loan book stood at Rs 1,06,880 crore as of March 2025 with a secured loan share of 73.01%. Lending segments include Enterprise loans (39.3%), Asset Finance (38.0%), and Consumer Finance (22.7%). Pan India presence with 1,771 branches in 1,162 towns across 31 states and UTs, 80% outside top 20 cities.</p>
<h3>Industry Overview</h3>

Credit penetration in India remains low compared to other developing countries, with significant opportunity especially in rural and semi-urban areas which are under-penetrated.
