<p>IGIL is a member of the Responsible Jewelry Council, promoting ethical, social, and environmental practices throughout the jewelry supply chain.

<h3>Important Events</h3>
<ul><li>December 2024: IGIL (India) completed acquisition of IGI Netherlands and IGI Belgium subsidiaries for Rs13.45 bn, consolidating global operations.</li><li>April 2024: Price cut of 20% in LGD certification services in response to wholesale price corrections.</li><li>March 2024: Certification of the largest lab-grown diamond weighing 75.33 carats named &#x27;Celebration of India&#x27;.</li><li>January 2024: IGIL certified jewelry adorned on Ram Lalla idol in Ram Mandir temple, a significant ceremonial accreditation.</li></ul>
<h3>Key Growth Drivers</h3>
<ul><li>Expanding global lab-grown diamond (LGD) market with IGIL’s 65% share in LGD certification driving volume growth.</li><li>Steady ramp-up in LGD jewelry adoption globally, especially in the US market where LGDs represent 45-50% of engagement ring volumes.</li><li>IGIL&#x27;s early mover advantage and strong strategic partnerships with leading LGD jewelry brands and producers.</li><li>Broad geographic footprint with dedicated in-factory labs and mobile labs supporting customer service and logistics efficiency.</li><li>Increasing certification penetration and rising consumer awareness creating higher demand for independent verification of diamond authenticity.</li><li>Growth in studded jewelry certification alongside LGD certifications.</li><li>Expansion of IGIL’s gemology education network cultivating skilled workforce and customer loyalty.</li></ul>
<h3>Key Risks</h3>
<ul><li>Pricing pressure and possible decline in LGD certification fees as wholesale LGD prices have corrected significantly.</li><li>Long-term relevance of third-party certification may diminish due to potential shift towards self or minimum certification by brands.</li><li>Improvement in default quality of LGDs reducing the need for third-party certification.</li><li>Increased competition from established players like GIA entering LGD certification and other emerging competitors.</li><li>High client concentration risk with top 10 clients contributing ~40% of revenue, without long-term exclusive contracts.</li><li>Operational risks including disruptions at client sites where on-site certification is conducted.</li><li>Attrition and challenges in recruiting and retaining skilled gemologists affecting service quality and capacity.</li><li>Volatility in supply of specialty certification paper which contributes ~3.8% of standalone sales cost.</li><li>Legal and reputational risks arising from ongoing litigation cases and subjective nature of diamond grading.</li></ul>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul><li>International Gemmological Institute Limited (IGIL) is the second-largest diamond certification provider globally by revenue, with market shares of approximately 50% in India and 33% worldwide. It commands a commanding ~65% share in LGD certification globally, highlighting its leadership in this fast-growing segment.</li><li>IGIL operates a widespread network of 31 laboratories and 18 gemology schools internationally, which supports over 7,500 customers encompassing LGD growers, natural diamond wholesalers, jewelry manufacturers, and retailers.</li><li>In fiscal year 2024, IGIL’s revenue was approximately Rs10.5 billion, driven by a 43% CAGR in LGD certification revenue to Rs5.7 billion. LGD certification contributed about 57% to overall certification revenues, indicating LGDs are central to IGIL’s growth strategy.</li><li>The company maintains an exceptional standalone EBITDA margin of about 72.8% and a standalone RoIC exceeding 80%, reinforcing its profitable and asset-light business model.</li><li>LGD certification prices were cut by 20% in April 2024 yet margins improved due to mix and operating leverage. Overseas subsidiaries contributed 25% of consolidated sales but reported losses attributed to geopolitical tensions and weak natural diamond demand.</li><li>IGIL forecasts 13.8% revenue CAGR, 14.4% EBITDA CAGR, and 13.5% EPS CAGR from calendar years 2024 to 2027, with a cautious view factoring in near-term margin pressures and competitive risks.</li><li>The valuation incorporates a multiple of 27X June 2027E EPS to arrive at a fair value of Rs375, acknowledging uncertainty from structural risks such as pricing pressure, long-term relevance of LGD certification, and possible industry shifts towards self-certification.</li><li>The investment thesis is tempered by concerns over the sustainability of high margins stemming from the commoditization of LGDs, competitive threats from established firms like GIA and new entrants, and client concentration risks.</li><li>IGIL is exposed to risks including technology shifts in certification, price declines in LGDs, rising competition potentially eroding market share and margins, and operational risks at client sites.</li><li>The management team is experienced and led by CEO Tehmasp Printer, with a strong backing from its major promoter BCP Asia II TopCo (Blackstone affiliate) holding a 76.55% stake (fully pledged).</li><li>IGIL invests in brand building and marketing but current advertising spends at ~2% of sales may be insufficient to maintain pricing premiums; a larger marketing push is likely essential.</li><li>IGIL has developed innovative certification technologies and holds multiple trademarks and patents, strengthening its technological moat in the diamond certification industry.</li></ul>
<h3>Recommendation Rationale</h3>
<ul><li>IGIL is a global leader in diamond certification with dominant market share, particularly in LGD certification, enabling strong revenue growth potential.</li><li>The company exhibits high profitability with standalone EBITDA margins above 70% and robust asset turnover due to its asset-light business model.</li><li>Significant growth in the LGD segment is expected to drive sustained expansion of IGIL&#x27;s certification volumes and revenues over 2024-2027.</li><li>However, there are material risks including pricing pressure on LGD certification services, long-term industry shifts away from third-party certification, and increased competition potentially compressing margins.</li><li>The uncertain sustainability of IGIL&#x27;s extraordinary margins and the structural risk to pricing prompt a cautious valuation approach.</li><li>We value IGIL at 27X June 2027E EPS yielding a fair value of Rs375, reflecting a reduction from current market price and anticipating downside risk.</li><li>Hence, we initiate coverage with a Sell rating due to modest downside potential amid near-term growth prospects and structural valuation risks.</li></ul>
