<h3>Sector</h3>
<p>Indian Defence Sector</p>
<h3>Period Covered</h3>

<h3>Analysts</h3>
<ul><li>Aniket Dharamshi</li><li>Arvind Ananthanarayanan</li><li>Vishrut Bubna</li></ul>
<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>The Indian defence sector has witnessed buoyant growth fueled by Government support, increasing private sector participation, and rising exports. Budget estimates for 2025-26 show a 6% increase over revised 2024-25, with INR 12,00,000 Cr. earmarked for capital expenditure over five years, predominantly for Navy and Airforce modernization. DAP-2020 policy has transformed procurement, bolstering indigenous manufacturing and DPSU-led ecosystems, driving substantial PAT growth for DPSUs and re-rating their valuations. Electronics and upgrades will dominate future capex.</p>
<h3>Overall Sentiment</h3>
<p>Optimistic</p>
<h3>Overall Sentiment Triggers</h3>
<ul><li>Strong capital expenditure pipeline of INR 12,00,000 Cr. over five years</li><li>Significant PAT improvement and re-rating for DPSUs post DAP-2020 reforms</li><li>Robust 6.6% CAGR in defence spending since 1960 aligning with economic growth</li><li>Emerging export opportunities from global geopolitical shifts</li><li>Increased private sector role in R&amp;D and manufacturing boosting innovation potential</li></ul>
<h3>Sector Highlights</h3>
<p>India&#x27;s defence spending has grown at a 6.6% CAGR since 1960, closely tracking GDP growth. However, defence spend as a percentage of GDP has declined to ~2.5% post-1990 liberalization. The army receives only ~10-15% of modernization budgets, with Navy and Airforce consuming ~90%. R&amp;D remains under 5% of the defence budget, pushing private sector involvement. The procurement cycle remains lengthy, often two to three years, with emergency procurements forming a small, high-margin but non-recurring share.</p>

<h3>Macro Trends</h3>
<p>Global geopolitical shifts, including US retreat from European defence and China’s increasing military capabilities, are reshaping security dynamics in the Indian Ocean region. Emerging warfare technologies emphasize asymmetric combat, drones, unmanned systems, cyber and information warfare, networked battlespaces requiring indigenous secure communication and sensor fusion. DRDO’s traditional R&amp;D supremacy is set to diminish as private sector and academia take a larger role under recommended organizational reforms.</p>
<h3>Headwinds Tailwinds</h3>
<b>Headwinds:</b>
<ul><li>High salary and pension expenditure constraining modernization budgets</li><li>Complex, time-consuming procurement processes (2-3 years typical)</li><li>Low R&amp;D spending under 5% of defence budget</li><li>Indian army modernization budget limited, constraining large system acquisitions</li><li>Legacy supply chains focused on imports and varied foreign suppliers</li><li>Offsets policy previously led to low-value add activities and limited tech transfer</li></ul>
<b>Tailwinds:</b>
<ul><li>DAP-2020 framework mandates indigenization and joint ventures with Indian firms</li><li>INR 12,00,000 Cr. capital expenditure plan over next five years</li><li>Government boost for private sector participation and exports</li><li>Robust demand driven by geopolitical tensions with China and Pakistan</li><li>Rising valuations and PAT growth in DPSUs due to policy reforms</li><li>Emerging export opportunities due to global rearmament trends</li></ul>
<h3>Key Statistics</h3>
<ul><li>Indian defence spending CAGR: 6.6% since 1960</li><li>GDP CAGR: 7.2% since 1960</li><li>Defence spending post-liberalization ~2.5% of GDP (previously ~4%)</li><li>Capital expenditure earmarked: INR 12,00,000 Cr. over five years</li><li>Military pension and salary consume over 50% of defence budget</li><li>Army receives only 10-15% of modernization budget</li><li>Defence R&amp;D under 5% of overall defence budget</li><li>Procurement cycle: typically 2-3 years</li></ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The Indian defence sector is at a pivotal growth phase fueled by Government initiatives like DAP-2020, rising capital expenditure, and expanding private sector roles. While DPSUs continue as lead integrators with improving financials, private companies with technology ownership and execution capability are poised to benefit from rising exports and domestic market expansion. Investing requires careful bottom-up stock selection focusing on innovation, high return ratios, and prudent project choices. The overall outlook is optimistic with electronics, upgrades, and exports driving future growth.</p>

<h3>Sector Specific</h3>
<p>The Indian defence sector transformation is underpinned by DAP-2020, which mandates indigenous content and Indian partnership majority stakes in joint ventures. This has created a tiered ecosystem with DPSUs as system integrators supported by private tier-2/tier-3 suppliers. Indian defence capex is heavily skewed to Navy and Airforce (~90%), focusing on modernization, electronics, radars and electronic warfare systems. The army, despite being the largest in troop size globally, attracts a small modernization share and remains personnel heavy with legacy procurement issues. Indian defence R&amp;D spending remains low (&lt;5%), prompting private sector and academia to take on growing R&amp;D roles, especially given DRDO reform proposals. India’s strategic geopolitical location and evolving maritime challenges from China via the Indian Ocean elevate naval and air power priorities in defence planning.</p>
